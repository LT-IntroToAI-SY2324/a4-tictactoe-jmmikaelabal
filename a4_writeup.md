# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
    The most difficult part to tic-tac-toe was creating each patterns of x's and o's; also check wins, losses, and draws for every pattern.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
    I would create a new function called playcomputer. I would probably create different strategies and patterns based on the players move in each box.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
    I would maybe create a database with different possible game outcomes and the steps needed to get to a win. I would then implement that into my function so that the computer choses the play needed to win the game.
